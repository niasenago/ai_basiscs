# Artificial neuron lab work

## Description
This is a lab work for Artifitial Inteligence Basics course unit in Vilnius University. It implements a simple artificial neuron model that classifies data using either a step or sigmoid activation function. The goal is to find suitable weight and bias values that correctly classify the input data.

## Usage
### Finding weights and bias
To find optimal weights and bias:

1) Run the `brute_force_search.py` script to find the best combinations of weights and bias that classify the data correctly.
2) Set the resulting values in the `weights.json` file.

### Running the neuron
Preconditions: input data, weights and bias are set.

Run the `main.py` script to apply the neuron model to the input data and observe the output. You'll be prompted to select an activation function.

### Visualizing results:
Run `visualize_data.json` script
